This article was originally published in The Perl Journal in January of 2003. The first releases of [plenv](https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv) and [perlbrew](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::perlbrew) appear to be in 2013 and 2010 respectively. Please, keep that in mind as you read.

The original website for The Perl Journal no longer exists. An archive of this article can be found on a personal site that seems to be hosting the old [Dr. Dobbs](https://jacobfilipp.com/DrDobbs/articles/TPJ/2003/0301/0301a/0301a.htm) site. Since that seems rather tenuous to me, I took that text and have now rehosted the article here.

### The Perl Journal January 2003

### By Matthew O. Persico

Managing change when you maintain a sizable Perl installation isn't easy. Inevitably, one of your colleagues will come to you and say, "I was looking at CPAN and you know, I could save myself two weeks of work if I could install the `Foo::Bar` module for use in my Yadayadayada project. Can we get it installed?"

"Sure," you reply. "I'll get right on it." You download the tarball from CPAN, execute:

```sh
gtar zxvf Foo-Bar-1.68.tar.gz
cd Foo-Bar-1.68
perl Makefile.PL
```

and then you see it:

```sh
Perl v5.8.0 required—this is only v5.6.1, stopped at Bar.pm line 2.
```

Okay, now what? Well, you can try to find a version of `Foo::Bar` that works with 5.6.1, but the odds are there isn't one. Even if there is such a version, it is probably old enough that it is missing needed functionality or has bugs that are fixed in later versions.

You could say, "Sorry, we can't support it," and you might even get away with that for just one module or just one project.

Eventually, however, the modules you support are going to be upgraded, new modules will be required, and your version of Perl is not going to support them.

That's the point where you start to consider an upgrade of Perl.

However, by this time, you've discovered that there are hundreds of Perl scripts and modules used in production. Every one of them will have to be regression tested before upgrading. Regression testing takes time away from development. Try selling _that_ to your end users.

The cost of upgrading any programming language environment is not trivial. You must make sure that every program works in the new environment in the same manner as it did in the old environment before you switch over to the new one. In addition, as more and more operating systems (at least in the \*NIX and Linux worlds) come with default installations of Perl that are critical to the smooth operation of the system, upgrading Perl or its default modules can negatively impact the operating system's performance.

It seems nearly impossible to safely upgrade Perl without a massive amount of testing. But there is a solution. Instead of upgrading Perl, you can "side-grade" it. This article will describe how to install and maintain multiple versions of Perl on a machine in a transparent and flexible manner. In this manner, you can port scripts on an as-needed basis and maintain multiple versions for testing on your development machines.

### Principles

In order to maintain multiple versions of Perl in an environment, we set down the following principles:

*   **Do no harm.** A user or process that knows nothing about our Perl-swapping environment should be presented with the default Perl environment that comes "out-of-the-box." This means that all paths should have default values that allow a process to use Perl without having to explicitly call any special functions or explicitly set any special environment variables.
*   **No pain, all gain.** The method for changing Perl versions should be as painless as possible. Ideally, one command should do it.
*   **You can go back.** There is no reason why the default version of Perl shouldn't be considered just another version of Perl to be swapped. You should be able to switch back to the default version of Perl as easily as to any other version.

To this end, we will create a shell script called `perl.sh` to be placed in the `/etc/profile.d` directory and called from `/etc/profile` upon login. It will create all functions needed to set a particular version of Perl in the environment, and it will set the default environment when first invoked.

I'll describe how to build `perl.sh` step by step. This is the easiest way to show you how to build the environment yourself, which will probably be necessary; your Perl may be in a different place, your modules may be scattered over multiple directories, and you may have a different version of Perl than I am describing here. Use this article and its code as a template—do not expect to drop this version of `perl.sh` onto your system without alteration.

### Standardizing the Default Perl Version

The first step is to get the default version of Perl properly set up using `perl.sh`. This will take a bit of work because the default version of Perl is already set up, so we do not want to clobber it when `perl.sh` is invoked the first time around. However, we must make sure that we can get back to the default version from another installed version if needed.

### Determine Locations

We need to get the locations of the Perl binary, modules, and manpages. One could use `perldoc` instead of manpages, but having the Perl manpages available is convenient if you are using GUI `man` tools.

First, execute the command `which perl`. In this case, the result is `/usr/bin/perl`, which tells us two things:

1\. Where the Perl binary lives.

2\. It is on a directory in `PATH`.

Next, execute `perl -V`. We ignore the build information for the moment and focus on the tail end of the output, which is shown in Example 1.

#### Example 1

```
Characteristics of this binary (from libperl):
  Compile-time options:
  Built under linux
  Compiled at Feb 21 2002 01:00:32
  @INC:
    /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/i386-linux
    /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/i386-linux
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl
    .
```

What this tells us is that there are no other known locations for Perl modules other than the default locations. Practically, that means that `PERL5LIB` is not set and that all modules added to the system must be installed into `/usr/lib/perl5`.

My personal philosophy on the subject of installation locations is simple: If I didn't build it, I won't write to it. I install all modules added to the system into another directory, even those that are upgrades of modules that are part of the out-of-the-box installation. Upgrading the default version of Perl or its modules in place could cause operating-system components to fail (as previously discussed). Furthermore, if you need to rebuild your system, you will have yet another item to attend to—rebuilding all the modules you added to or updated in the default location. If these modules are installed elsewhere, then when you restore the same version of Perl under which the modules were originally installed to the default location, the add-on modules should be immediately available (assuming you unmounted and did not reformat that partition in the rebuild). Finally, one can, if necessary, cut off access to the upgraded versions by removing the directory from `PERL5LIB` and allow usage of the default modules since they still exist in the original Perl tree.

I am going to establish `/opt/perl/lib` as the location for my new modules. I am doing this because I consider Perl to be a product unto itself. `/usr` and `/usr/local` are good places to stash shared objects like libraries or executables. Perl, however, has a pretty intricate directory structure of its own. Isolating the structure makes it easier to do our environment modifications to swap versions later.

The exact setting of `PERL5LIB` that is needed to produce a valid @INC seems to have changed from release 5.004_04 through 5.005, 5.6.0, 5.6.1, and 5.8.0. Furthermore, the end result is highly dependent on where and how Perl is configured and installed in the first place. Rather than try to determine the settings via the documentation, I suggest you determine it empirically with these steps:

1. Create `/opt/perl`.

2. Grab any module from CPAN.

3. Unwind the tarball and perform the magic incantations:

```sh
perl Makefile.PL
make test install PREFIX=/opt/perl
```

4\. Take note of where the module is installed.

You'll notice that I set `PREFIX` at installation time. This is a result of the environment in which I was trained. By setting `PREFIX` at install time instead of Makefile at creation time, I can use the same tarball tree to install to a local testing area, a global testing area, and a production area without having to reexecute `perl Makefile.PL` each time. You may feel differently. Feel free to specify `PREFIX` at `perl Makefile.PL` time. The only caveat is that you must be consistent. Pick one method and stick with it. I vaguely recall that in one version of Perl, the end location of the module was different depending on which method was used. This is another example of why I am demonstrating the empirical method of building this framework.

Finally, test `man` capabilities. When I try `man perl`, the manpage appears. This indicates that we can get to the manpages in Section 1 for Perl commands. When I try `man ExtUtils::MakeMaker`, the manpage does not appear. A quick check of the environment reveals that there is no `MANPATH` environment variable set. Therefore, `man` is using its own heuristics to determine where manpages are located. By reexamining the top of the `perl -V` output, we see the information in Example 2.

#### Example 2: Determining default manpath information from the output of perl -V.

```
Summary of my perl5 (revision 5.0 version 6 subversion 1) configuration:
  Platform:
    osname=linux, osvers=2.4.16-6mdksmp, archname=i386-linux
    uname='linux bi.mandrakesoft.com 2.4.16-6mdksmp #1 smp sat dec 8 04:02:48 cet 2001 i686 unknown'
    config_args='-des -Darchname=i386-linux -Dd_dosuid -Ud_csh -Duseshrplib -Doptimize=-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mcpu=pentiumpro -march=i586 -ffast-math -fno-strength-reduce -Dprefix=/usr -D_ndbm -D_gdbm -D_shadow_syslog -Uuselargefiles -Dman1dir=/usr/share/man/man1 -Dman3dir=/usr/lib/perl5/man/man3'
```

The flag `-Dman3dir` defines a location for module manpages that is not going to appear in a default manpath due to its location, which is not "near" a `PATH` entry. Even if this path did appear in the default manual path, it would not help us. Without a `MANPATH` variable to manipulate, we are not going to be able to swap in manpages that correspond to the version of Perl that we want to change. So, the first order of business is to fix this.

In most versions of `man`, setting `MANPATH` completely overrides `man`'s heuristics; it does not add new paths to the default ones. This is not a problem, however. There is usually a program `manpath` that will print the default paths used by `man` in the absence of a `MANPATH` variable. So, we create `man.sh` and put it in `/etc/profile.d`. This ensures that the variable is set for each login process. The contents of `man.sh` are simply:

```sh
MANPATH='manpath'
export MANPATH
```

This is strict Bourne Shell syntax. Korn or bash users can try:

```sh
export MANPATH=$(manpath)
```

I will use bash shell syntax from now on. Bourne Shell users can make the necessary adjustments.

Now we will be able to alter the `man` environment to match our Perl environment. It might be argued that setting `MANPATH` to override `man`'s heuristics defeats the purpose of having them. In truth, the only time it matters is when installing new software. Without a `MANAPTH` set, `man` will automatically find the new `man` directory if it is "close" to a directory on the `PATH`. But a new `PATH` entry is only available to processes that log in after installation, unless a process (or more likely a user) resets `PATH`. Logging out and in again should rerun the `/etc/profile.d` files, including our new `manpath.sh`, which will reexecute the `manpath` call and pick up any newly installed manpages if they follow the heuristics.

Create the `set` and `unset` Functions

We will create a function named `set_perl_5.6.1`. It will perform three functions:

1\. Set `PATH` so that the 5.6.1 version of Perl is on the path.

2\. Set `PERL5LIB` so that any extra libraries are found.

3\. Set `MANPATH` so that the Perl manpages are located.

Here is the code:

```sh
set_perl_5.6.1()
{
  export PERL_CURRENT_VERSION=5.6.1
  addpath -f PATH /opt/perl/bin
  add_perl5lib /opt/perl
  addpath -f MANPATH /usr/lib/perl5/man
  addpath -f MANPATH /opt/perl/lib/perl5/man
}
```

`PERL_CURRENT_VERSION` is defined in order to keep track of what version we are currently running. `addpath` is a function that will add a directory to a `PATH`-like environment variable. It makes use of the `PERL_DEFAULT` variable. <a name="rl1"></a>See [Listing 1](#listing-1) for the code. `addpath` and `delpath` are translations of shell scripts and are described in the following _Linux Journal_ articles: [Shell Functions and Path Variables, Part 1](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3645), [Shell Functions and Path Variables, Part 2](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3768), and [Shell Functions and Path Variables, Part 3](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php/3935).

In this case, we add `/opt/perl/bin` to`PATH` because there are modules (such as `DBI`) that create binaries. This is where they will end up when installed. Why not `/opt/perl/bin/5.6.1` or `/opt/perl/5.6.1/bin`? Because when we execute `make install PREFIX=/opt/perl`, the remainder of the paths are taken from Perl's current configuration, and the configuration, in this case, is to put all binaries into `$PREFIX/bin`. `add_perl5lib` is another function, presented in Example 3 with its relatives.

#### Example 3: The add_perl5lib function.

```sh
add_perl5lib () {
  guts_perl5lib ${1} add
}

del_perl5lib ()
{
  guts_perl5lib ${1} del
}

guts_perl5lib ()
{
  for i in $(find ${1}/lib -name ${PERL_CURRENT_VERSION} -type d | sort -r)
  do
    ${2}path -f -p PERL5LIB $(dirname $i)
  done
  export PERL5LIB
}
```

We find the directories corresponding to the current version of Perl under the requested top-level directory and add or delete them from the `PERL5LIB` environment variable.

The corresponding `unset` function is:

```sh
unset_perl_5.6.1()
{
  delpath -f MANPATH /opt/perl/lib/perl5/man
  delpath -f MANPATH /usr/lib/perl5/man
  del_perl5lib /opt/perl
  delpath -f PATH /opt/perl/bin
  unset PERL_CURRENT_VERSION
}
```

`delpath` is a function that will add a directory to a `PATH`-like environment variable; see <a name="rl2">[Listing 2](#listing-2). Detailed discussion of the function is beyond the scope of this article.

You will notice that the actions in the `unset` function are performed in inverse order of the corresponding `set` actions. Although this is not strictly required, it is imperative that the setting and unsetting of `PERL_CURRENT_VERSION` be the first and last actions of their respective functions. All of the other functions make use of the value of `PERL_CURRENT_VERSION`, so it must be available to execute the actions.

Add all of this code to `perl.sh` and all the defaults are now defined for your out-of-the-box version of Perl.

As a last note, notice that we do not add or delete the default path for Perl from `PATH`. There are a number of reasons. In most cases, the path for the default version of Perl is shared. In this case, removing `/usr/bin` from`PATH` would have dire consequences. A similar argument applies to the default `MANPATH` entry `/usr/share/man` where the section 1 manpages live.

You always want to leave a minimum version of Perl in `PATH` because the `addpath` and `delpath` utilities use Perl to do their magic.

Up to this point, this all has been an interesting exercise, but without a second version of Perl, there is really no reason to have gone through all this work. Let's install another version of Perl.

### Build a New Version of Perl

I will demonstrate by installing version 5.8.0 into `/opt/perl`. During the configure phase (which I invoke using `sh Configure`), I take all the default values except for the prompts shown in Example 4.

#### Example 4: Configure questions for which you must override the defaults.

```
Installation prefix to use? (~name ok) [/usr/local] /opt/perl

Pathname where the public executables will reside? (~name ok) [/opt/perl/bin] /opt/perl/bin/5.8.0

Many scripts expect perl to be installed as /usr/bin/perl.
I can install the perl you are about to compile also as /usr/bin/perl
(in addition to /opt/perl/bin/5.8.0/perl).
Do you want to install perl as /usr/bin/perl? [y] n

Where do the main Perl5 manual pages (source) go? (~name ok)
[/opt/perl/man/man1] /opt/perl/man/5.8.0/man1

Pathname where the add-on public executables should be installed? (~name ok) [/opt/perl/bin] /opt/perl/bin/5.8.0
```

Subsequent questions will have their defaults altered based on these answers. (For example, we will not need to explicitly set the `man` directory for modules \[section 3\]. Configure is smart enough to change the default to `/opt/perl/man/5.8.0/man3` given the setting of man1.) I do not show those questions here since all you have to do is hit RETURN to take the now modified defaults. In order to make installation a bit smoother, create the directory `/opt/perl/bin/5.8.0`

and unset `PERL5LIB` (if you've set it) before starting Configure. Example 4 above shows the questions for which you must override the defaults.

Notice that we chose the location for the version number in `/opt/perl/bin/5.8.0` and `/opt/perl/man/5.8.0/man1` in order to mimic the structure of the lib directory that this version of Perl builds. This is not standard practice. It does, however, make our swapping code much easier to create.

Once configured, complete the installation with

make test install

### Determine Locations

We now need to get the location of the 5.8.0 Perl binary, modules and manpages.

The location of `perl` is easy since we specified it: `/opt/perl/ bin/5.8.0`. Make sure that `PERL5LIB` is unset and execute `/opt/perl/ bin/5.8.0/perl -V`. Again, we are only interested in the tail; see Example 5.

#### Example 5: The output of perl -V after installing 5.8.0.

```
Characteristics of this binary (from libperl):
  Compile-time options: USE_LARGE_FILES
  Built under linux
  Compiled at Dec  3 2002 23:42:03
  @INC:
    /opt/perl/lib/5.8.0/i686-linux
    /opt/perl/lib/5.8.0
    /opt/perl/lib/site_perl/5.8.0/i686-linux
    /opt/perl/lib/site_perl/5.8.0
    /opt/perl/lib/site_perl
    .
```

Now, unlike our 5.6.1 installation, we can proceed without setting `PERL5LIB` and allow modules to be installed right into `/opt/perl/lib/site_perl`. After all, we built this version and, therefore, have no default installation to preserve.

### Create the `set` and `unset` Functions

We will create a function named `set_perl_5.8.0`. It will perform three functions:

1\. Set`PATH` so that the 5.8.0 version of Perl is on the path.

2\. Set `PERL5LIB` so that any extra libraries are found.

3\. Set `MANPATH` so that the Perl manpages are located.

Here is the code:

```sh
set_perl_5.8.0()
{
  export PERL_CURRENT_VERSION=5.8.0
  addpath -f PATH /opt/perl/bin/5.8.0
  addpath -f MANPATH /opt/perl/man/5.8.0
}
The corresponding _unset_ function is:
unset_perl_5.8.0()
{
  delpath -f MANPATH /opt/perl/man/5.8.0
  delpath -f PATH /opt/perl/bin/5.8.0
  unset PERL_CURRENT_VERSION
}
```

Add these two functions to `perl.sh` and we're almost finished.

### Create the `swap_perl` Function

The last function to consider is the one that actually does the swapping. You could always code something like

```sh
unset_perl_${PERL_CURRENT_VERSION}
swap_perl_5.8.0
```

before all calls to Perl, but that gets tedious after a while and is highly error prone. <a name="rl3">[Listing 3](#listing-33) shows the function `swap_perl` with commentary. In order to use the function, simply call it before executing any Perl script:

```sh
swap_perl 5.8.0
perl foobar.pl
```

If you keep project-specific library locations, you can add them via arguments to `swap_perl`:

```sh
swap_perl 5.8.0 /opt/myCompany/yadayadayada
```

The last lines in `perl.sh` should set the default Perl environment. Example 6 shows the specifics of our installation.

#### Example 6: Setting the default Perl environment in perl.sh.

```sh
## PERL_DEFAULT is used by various utilities that need to have
## access to some version of Perl while we are in the middle of
## swapping Perl versions. See addpath and delpath for example.
export PERL_DEFAULT=/usr/bin/perl

## This setting tells swap_perl that there is no current version to
## swap out of before swapping in the requested version.
export PERL_CURRENT_VERSION='initial'

## Do it
swap_perl 5.6.1
```

### Perl Version Selection and the Shebang Line

Perl scripts are usually executed by setting their protection mode to executable (+x in the \*NIX and Linux worlds) and invoking the script directly. By placing a shebang line at the top of the script, the shell will invoke the specified program in order to process the script. The usual shebang line is something like:

```sh
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
```

The problem with this is that it totally defeats the mechanism of putting the desired Perl executable in the `PATH`. One way around this is to modify the shebang line:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env perl
```

From the manpage header:

```sh
env - run a program in a modified environment
```

In this usage, we do not modify the environment with the assignment of any variables; we simply use env's `PATH`-searching capabilities to find the version of Perl we desire.

### Shell Game

In order to swap versions of Perl on a case-by-case basis, you have to invoke `swap_perl` before any call to Perl. For `at` jobs, you must either call `swap_perl` in the job definition or in your own environment before the `at` job is created. For `cron` jobs or commercial job schedulers such as AutoSys, you may have to wrap the command in a shell that calls `swap_perl` before invoking the Perl script.

### Never Look Back

One of the potential disadvantages of having multiple versions of Perl is the need to install new modules in both places. I avoid that problem with the following policy: Once a new version of Perl has been tested enough to go into production, it is placed there with the latest version of all modules that have been installed with the last version. Any new module installations are performed on the new version only. If a developer wants/needs a new module or a module upgrade, he must migrate to the latest Perl version in order to access the module. An exception to this policy can be made for a show-stopping production bug. However, the developer will be highly encouraged to migrate immediately.

You should suggest that your developers put a `swap_perl` statement in their profiles (`.bash_profile` in bash) so that they are always working in the latest version.

### Perl Versions Prior to 5.6.0

The directory layout of Perl has evolved over the years. If any of the versions of Perl that you are dealing with are earlier than 5.6.0, you may have to do some more experimentation in setting `PERL5LIB` in order to have @INC properly set. This may, in turn, require you to put version-specific code in the `add_perl5lib` function. `add_perl5lib` can be useful in its own right—I use `add_perl5lib` and `del_perl5lib` at the command line to temporarily choose between multiple versions of a module that I have installed in separate local trees in order to test the effect of upgrading a modules.

### Conclusion

Here is a summary of the steps needed to maintain multiple versions of Perl:

1. Determine the default locations of the Perl binary, modules, and manpages.

2. Create `set` and `unset` functions for this version of Perl. Place them in `perl.sh`.

3. Install new versions of Perl, taking care to isolate them in highly version-numbered directory structures.

4. Determine the locations of the Perl binary, modules, and manpages for the new version.

5. Create `set` and `unset` functions for this version of Perl. Place them in `perl.sh`.

6. Add `swap_perl` to `perl.sh`. Add a command to swap in the default version at the bottom of `perl.sh`. Place `perl.sh` in /etc/profile.d.

7. Call `swap_perl` in your process before executing Perl scripts.

8. Change the shebang line of Perl scripts to use the `env` command, which will search `PATH` for the desired version of Perl.
